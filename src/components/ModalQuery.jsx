      <p>
        Boohoo your tomato plan has late blight ðŸ˜¦ Treating late blight in
        tomato plants requires a multi-pronged approach to effectively manage
        the disease. As soon as symptoms are noticed, it's crucial to remove and
        dispose of any infected plant parts to prevent its spread. Applying
        fungicides with copper-based compounds or other effective ingredients
        can help halt the disease's progression. Improving air circulation by
        pruning excess foliage and using drip irrigation to water at the base of
        plants can create an environment less favorable for the pathogen. Opting
        for tomato varieties resistant to late blight can offer long-term
        protection.

        It looks like spider mites! Applying insecticidal soap or neem oil can
        be effective in controlling mites while being less harmful to beneficial
        insects. Ensure the plants are well-watered and not under stress, as
        healthy plants can better resist infestations. Regularly inspect the
        undersides of leaves for signs of mites, such as webbing and stippling

        containing chlorothalonil or other effective ingredients as per
        recommendations. Mulch around the base of plants to prevent soil
        splashing onto leaves. Water at the base to keep foliage dry, reducing
